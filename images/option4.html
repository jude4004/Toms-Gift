    <h1>The blanket Choice</h1>
    <p> Tom choses the rainbow blacket. What he doesn't know is that that Choice
    will change his relationship with his grandma forever.
  So on thanksgiving day he gave her the blacket and said," Grand, thanks for
  raising me and I hope this gift made you it bit more happy then you already
  are."</p>
     <p>What did his grandma do? </p>
